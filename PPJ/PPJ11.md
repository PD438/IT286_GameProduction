Total Amount of Hours Worked on the Project: 
1 Hour and 30 mins. 

Notes on the Project:  Unfortunately we did not work as much on the project because everyone believes that we are finished mostly with the project. 
 Even though i look at the issues, there are not much issues with that correlate with sound. 
 Although i am very excited working on the project, i felt sound was the way to go for me. 
 I can not wait to work on more issues.
