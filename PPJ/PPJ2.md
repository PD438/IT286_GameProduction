PPJ Paulo Duarte PPJ Week 03

Tasks:

Updating a portion of team contract(4 hours)
Updated Individual Contract(30 Mins)

I have updated a portion of the team contract.  I am excited on this project but extremely nervous at the same time because of the other projects i must complete in order for this to be successful.  
I have shown a website that has pre made audio that we can be able to use because of how accessible it is to place it in the game.  The thing now, is that i must learn is to make it work in tangent with animation crew.  So i must work alot with my team and be active.  Also, i got to stop being lazy because i have people counting on me. 
My goal is to use the audio my team approves and be able to implement it for my team and gather feedback.  
I promise to be there for my team.
