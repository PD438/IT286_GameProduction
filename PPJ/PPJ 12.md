Total Amount of Hours Worked On Project: 
4 Hours 
Tasks Worked On: 
Completed Making The Patch Notes for the game so that i can hand it in for tomorrow. 
I also sat down with Michael for him to teach me about how to animate the items in blender.
I animated the items of the barrel and the monkey faces make them specifically unique.  Not gonna lie i am alot more prouder to make these items for it to animate.
Another thing that i have worked on is the patch notes. The goal of it is to specifically write it as if i was a developer for a big game company.
