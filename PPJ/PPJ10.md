Total Amount of Hours Worked on the Project: 2 Hours 
We have finally completed the second beta test for the project and its nice to see the progress of the project. 
People were actualy surpised of the jump scare which was really good to see. 
It really was nice to see things that were coming together and the fact that people were liking the game shows that it was good and the feedback was taken really well.  
I have plans to refine more of the audio before i place it on steam.  
I will ask dean of students later today before i publish.
