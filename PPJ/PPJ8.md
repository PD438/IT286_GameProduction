Total Hours Worked on the Project:
2 Hours
The things that i have completed for this week was the personal milestone and the preparation of this PPJ. Fortunately, I have researched more sound clips that we could use for the doorknob hallucination.  
Unfortunately i did not get the grade i wanted in the milestone 2 because although I felt i did what i presented for it was good to get a decent grade. but it is what it is. I did finally got the stuff to work the audio script and it is really cool to see.
I learned alot more things about sound since i have created  the audio dictionary and been working on blender.  I def need to work more on blender because i would like to make animation actually work.  
The current goal i have is to complete this issues that are tasked to me before the playtest occurs.  IF not i would like to get it done before the beta because the beta is soon.  I will make an appointment with the professor to find ways on how to improve the grade.
