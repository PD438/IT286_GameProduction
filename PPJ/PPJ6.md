Total Amount of time spent working on the game this week: 4 Hours

This week I made an object on blender.  I started to propose to make more objects on blender because I am starting to understand how to make these items more on blender.  The personal milestone for me is going to be a lot easier because I have actually done some modeling on blender and making items for it is going to be a lot easier.  
During break I am going to use the advice the professor gave me so that I can be able to complete this project for the group.  Lastly, I am using my game from the other class so that it can have a easter egg for players to research our work.
