- TASKS:  
Major Contributioons to the project that i have done during my time in this class is sound directing.  
I have implemented the sounds in the game using a audio dictionary.  
Another thing to note that i have done for this project is implementing some models for the game and also i have given implementations on how the game should be played.
I have also learned how to use blender and give the models to thomas to implement into the game.

-PROS: 
I felt that the game was going to be a success because of how many people are actually interested in our game.  
I felt the communication with my team was actually an amazing that has happened with them. 
We were able to implement everything that we wanted to implement 
I am glad that we have this team because although there were some cons.
Lastly, i felt that with this project, i definitely wanted more to do because i was so excited to learn in this course.  


Cons:  I felt that with the game i wish we used a different engine. 
I also felt that i did not do enough for my team mates even though i wanted to focus on the sound. 
Another thing that i would like to do in the future is to be able to do more for my team. 
Lastly, i did not like my contract because i had things there that i definitely did alot more for that i shouldve given myself credit for.  all in all i had fun with this project.
