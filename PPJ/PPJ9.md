Total Amount of Hours Worked on the Project: 2 Hours 
The things that i have worked on was the remainder touches that i needed to get done for the presentation tomorrow. 
Below is the blender file that i have created for Thomas to use for the toy chest to present for tomorrow. 
The plan for tomorrow is to be able to present the items to the best of my ability.  The results that i have got from the playtest was very interesting because of how alot of the people i had played the game did not have their feedback in the playtest report. 
But it is extremely exciting to see that the people in my discord were very looking forward to see more of the games progress.  
All in all, the project is going smoothly and any further changes ill need to make, best believe i will do it to the best that i can.
