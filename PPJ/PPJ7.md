Hours worked on the project preparing for Personal Milestone: 4 hours
Time spent on blender guru tutorial: 2 hours
Time spent on creating items from blender: 2 hours
Implementing them from Blender to Unity:30 mins

Difficulty in the project: Me actually learning blender for the first time was legit a pain in the butt, I have never ever done any modeling and i was horrible in art class when i was young so i always avoided modeling items like the plague.  So actually sitting down and learning it was like such a new step for me. But once professor gave me the tool, i felt better using it. and i feel way more confident.

Overall Thoughts:
Using alot of the help from Professor Truesdell, i have made my own scriptable audio so that it can palce the actual audio files and have it be accessible for everyone. 
I was thinking alot during my spring break about how i can be a better teammate because i felt like i was not doing enough even though i was so excited on working on this project.  But I felt that since i was so swamped with other assignments i could not give my efforts on making the audio script and making this a very good game.  But since i was able to complete this as fast as possible so that my teammates can be able to work on their items really helped me evolve more as a teammate.  
I honestly felt that for this personal milestone i have actually done alot more and felt way more proud about the progress of this project instead of solely relying i can be able to work and make the progress.  Not gonna lie, it feels so good. I can not wait to work on more of the project. I am going to the dean of students to see how to push this game once it is complete on steam and see what I must do for my team. 
In terms of the beta, I want to make the video to display more of my unique skills that i have learned when i was working on my youtube channel during the summer. Also, I want to help my team with presentation skills because i notice everyone in the group except me is comfortable speaking in front of a crowd.  What i noticed was that they were either looking away and not looking at the people they were presenting to during the alpha so i will take some time this week to help everyone.

Looking Ahead: 
I would like to make the survey for the playtest and also make some more items from blender so that i can complete more modeling and also complete more unique tasks.
